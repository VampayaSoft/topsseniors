              Are you a family caregiver in need of respite care for your loved
              one?
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the Family Caregiver Alliance, 17-25% of caregivers
              are at risk for caregiver burnout due to the deterioration of
              their own personal health as a result of being a primary
              caregiver.
            </p>
            <p>
              We know that the day in the life of a caregiver, supporting a
              frail or elderly family member, can include but is not limited to
              many of the following tasks, such as: providing transportation to
              and from appointments, overseeing medication regimens, providing
              assistance with grocery ordering/shopping, encouraging physical
              activity such as exercise and therapeutic stretch, assisting with
              personal care, and ensuring your loved one is consuming nutritious
              meals. The previously stated, can be daunting and can leave little
              room for the caregiver to care for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here at Thriving Outlook for Prospering Seniors (T.O.P.S.) Adult
              Day Care, we are an alternative senior care solution that will
              allow your loved one to age in place, while avoiding a retirement
              home, assisted living facility, or nursing home; yet allowing for
              daytime caregiver relief.

          <div>
            <p>
              Our adult day care is operated by a registered nurse who
              specializes in senior care as well as other qualified, experienced
              caregivers. In addition, we provide a supervised loving
              environment for seniors that includes scheduled activities, guest
              entertainment, nutritious meals and snacks, and emotional support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having experienced firsthand the needs of the caregiver, the staff
              at Thriving Outlook for Prospering Seniors (T.O.P.S.) empathizes
              with the caregiver. We actively seek to relieve the caregiver
              burden and to enrich the lives of seniors each day! Our mission is
              to become an extension of your family, welcoming your loved one
              into ours. We are here as a resource and as family to lean on.

            Montessori Philosophy
          </h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Pioneer Dr. Maria Montessori revolutionized education for children
              by allowing them to learn within prepared environments suitable
              for their stage of development. Although Dr. Montessori did not
              design environments for older adults or those suffering with
              dementia, similar techniques are applied here at T.O.P.S. to
              promote an engaging and stimulating environment for our family.
            </p>
            <p>
              By creating materials and environments that allow accomplishment
              and a sense of purpose, the Montessori philosophy applied to
              seniors emphasizes their unique capabilities. This approach allows
              each family member to be as independent as possible and to engage
              in purposeful and meaningful activity. In addition, providing
              choice in every interaction is a key feature of this approach. For
              example, holding up two snacks and asking, “Would you like to eat
              this snack or this one?” Integrating simple choice preserves
              autonomy while removing the complex decision-making that is often
              more difficult for those who suffer from dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our activities are designed to focus on principles such as
              demonstrating how to perform an activity before inviting the
              family member to join in; breaking down activities into steps that
              can be performed one at a time, and extensive use of external aids
              and templates to support various levels of ability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our philosophy at T.O.P.S. is that each person deserves respect
              and dignity while contributing to their environment in a
              meaningful way.

                The founder of T.O.P.S. is Nichole "Nikki" Blake-Little. Nikki
                has a degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing. She has over 16
                years of nursing and senior care experience, ranging from
                in-hospital acute care to serving as a Director of Nursing in a
                senior living community. Nikki is certified in
                Dementia/Alzheimer's care. She also volunteers on the board of
                directors of Elder Options for Lake County, Florida.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nikki is passionate about enhancing the safety and quality of
                life of seniors. She believes that seniors are owed honor - as
                many of their sacrifices have paved the way to a better life for
                her generation. Nikki was raised by her adorn great-grandmother
                Mable Montgomery. Therefore, she has a particular appreciation
                for the strength, resilience, and wisdom that the present
                generation of seniors brings. There is no one more trusted to
                advocate for your family and the elders in your life.

              Matthew 25:40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever
              you did for one of the least of these, you did for Me.’"

              We at T.O.P.S. are not an institution; we are family, and you and
              your loved one will become our family members.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jesus told us we are to love God and love others. This is to be
              done through our everyday interaction with others. Everyone
              matters, and everyone has a purpose. We are all family.
