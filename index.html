          <p>
            Matthew 25:40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you
            did for one of the least of these, you did for Me.’ "<br /><br />
            Jesus told us we are to love God and love others. This is to do
            through our everyday actions as we interact with others. Everyone
            matters, and everyone has a purpose. We are all family. <br /><br />
            Experiencing firsthand the needs of the caregiver of an adult family
            member, the staff at T.O.P.S. empathizes with the caregivers. We
            know the love and care it takes to give the proper attention your
            family member needs. Our mission is to become an extension of your
            family, welcoming your family member as our family member. This
            passion goes beyond the family member and reaches to you, the
            caregiver. We are here as a resource and as a family to lean on.

            What is Montessori Method?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Montessori Method with older adults with dementia has taken
            root. The Montessori philosophy is that each person deserves respect
            and dignity. We must see “the person” in a person with dementia. As
            Montessori revolutionized education for children by providing choice
            within prepared environments, the same way of thinking can
            revolutionize the way we work with persons with dementia.
            <br /><br />
            By creating materials and environments that allow accomplishment and
            a sense of purpose, The Montessori Method applied to dementia
            emphasizes the use of remaining capabilities, the ability to improve
            with practice, and the need to enable a person who happens to have
            dementia to be as independent as possible, to engage in purposeful
            and meaningful activity. <br /><br />
            Providing choice in every interaction with the person with dementia
            is a key feature of this approach, such as holding up two snacks and
            asking, “Would you like to eat this snack or this one?” <br /><br />
            Having the opportunity to see dishes on a menu enables persons with
            dementia to make informed choices during meals and selection of
            entertainment. Activities focus on principles such as demonstrating
            how to perform an activity before asking a person with dementia to
            do it (using clear, slow demonstrations as well as the application
            of the three-period lesson), breaking down activities into steps
            that can be performed one at a time, extensive use of external aids
            and templates.

                The founder of T.O.P.S. is Nichole "Nikki" Blake-Little. Nikki
                has a degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing. She has over 16
                years of nursing and senior care experience, ranging from
                in-hospital acute care to serving as a Director of Nursing in a
                senior living community. Nikki is certified in
                Dementia/Alzheimer's care. She also volunteers on the board of
                directors of Elder Options for Lake County, Florida.
                <br /><br />
                Nikki is passionate about enhancing the safety and quality of
                life of seniors. She believes that seniors are owed honor - as
                many of their sacrifices have paved the way to a better life for
                her generation. Nikki was raised by her adorn great-grandmother
                Mable Montgomery. Therefore, she has a particular appreciation
                for the strength, resilience and wisdom that the present
                generation of seniors brings. There is no one more trusted to
                advocate for your family and the elders in your life.
