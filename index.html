          <h2>
            This is a mission statement. Explain why and how started - personal
            stories are important for people to relate. Could also include
            religious aspects. A mix of both will make it better (build trust
            and empathy).

        <section id="montessori" class="method center">
          <h2>
            Why Montessori method? This section could be a several sentences
            paragraph with links to studies. In future would be good if somebody
            captures a senior doing montessori activity and use such photo here.
          </h2>
        </section>
        <section id="services" class="services center">
          <h2>
            This section should describe the services y'all will provide. Later
            this section could also have few pictures of how activities during
            sessions or facilities look etc. This might be also a place to
            mention any disclaimers for liabilities purpose.
          </h2>
        </section>
        <section id="staff" class="staff center">
          <h2>
            This section is about staff. Most important part to show off staff's
            competency (like nurses experience, education etc.). Should include
            a picture, full name, education/experience info.
          </h2>
        </section>
        <section id="appointments" class="book center">
          <h2>
            This section is for making appointments. Explaining the situation
            why walk-ins are not welcome. Could also be a place to request a
            prayer.
          </h2>
        </section>
        <section id="resources" class="resources center">
          <h2>
            This will be the section for resources, like videos (or linking to
            youtube channel, or another page dedicated to videos)
          </h2>
        </section>
        <section id="donate" class="donate center">
          <h2>
            This will be the section for donations. Here is a good place to
            explain what people don't know: how state laws require so many
            nurses per so many people, how in cases of emergency, like food
            worth of specific time needs to be provided, what bills need to
            cover etc - these are all reasons why it's important to donate etc.
            This can also be a place to mention volunteering. Might explain even
            rules around food donation etc.
