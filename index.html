            This is a mission statement. Explain why and how started - personal
            stories are important for people to relate. Could also include
            religious aspects. A mix of both will make it better (build trust
            and empathy).

              <p>
                The founder of T.O.P.S. is Nichole "Nikki" Blake-Little. Nikki
                has a degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing. She has over 16
                years of nursing and senior care experience, ranging from
                in-hospital acute care to serving as a Director of Nursing in a
                senior living community. Nikki is certified in
                Dementia/Alzheimer's care. She also volunteers on the board of
                directors of Elder Options for Lake County, Florida.
                <br /><br />
                Nikki is passionate about enhancing the safety and quality of
                life of seniors. She believes that seniors are owed honor - as
                many of their sacrifices have paved the way to a better life for
                her generation. Nikki was raised by her adorn great-grandmother
                Mable Montgomery. Therefore, she has a particular appreciation
                for the strength, resilience and wisdom that the present
                generation of seniors brings. There is no one more trusted to
                advocate for your family and the elders in your life.
