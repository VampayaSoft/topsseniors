            This is a mission statement. Explain why and how started - personal
            stories are important for people to relate. Could also include
            religious aspects. A mix of both will make it better (build trust
            and empathy).

          <h2>
            Why Montessori method? This section could be a several sentences
            paragraph with links to studies. In future would be good if somebody
            captures a senior doing montessori activity and use such photo here.

            reservation is easy.

            Call
            <a href="tel:+13525549025">352-554-9025</a> or send an

        <section id="donate" class="donate center">
          <h2>
            This will be the section for donations. Here is a good place to
            explain what people don't know: how state laws require so many
            nurses per so many people, how in cases of emergency, like food
            worth of specific time needs to be provided, what bills need to
            cover etc - these are all reasons why it's important to donate etc.
            This can also be a place to mention volunteering. Might explain even
            rules around food donation etc.
